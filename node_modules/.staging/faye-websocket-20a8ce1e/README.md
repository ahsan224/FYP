# faye-websocket

This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket
API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network).

It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events)
connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to
the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access
via proxies than WebSockets.


## Installation

```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```


## Handling WebSocket connections in Node

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);

    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });

    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:

```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```

Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.

If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.

If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.

```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```


## Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');

ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});

ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});

ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```

The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.

To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: { 'User-Agent': 'node' },
    tls:     { cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt') }
  }
});
```

The `tls` value is an object that will be
